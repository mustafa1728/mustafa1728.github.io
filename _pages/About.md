I am a final year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science from IIT Delhi. Interested in pursuing research in the fields of AI and ML, I am actively looking for new ways to learn how to learn. 

My interest lies broadly in Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I was a Deep Learning Research Intern at Sony, Japan and a Research Intern at the University of Sheffield. I have worked on multiple research projects and publications exploring fields including adversarial robustness, zero/few shot learning, weak/semi supervised learning, instance segmentation and skill evaluation.

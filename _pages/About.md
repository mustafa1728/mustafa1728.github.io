Hi there! I am a final year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science from IIT Delhi. Interested in pursuing research in the fields of AI and ML, I am actively looking for new ways to learn how to learn. 

I was a Deep Learning Research Intern at Sony, Japan and a Research Intern at the University of Sheffield, exploring and learning about latest research and best practices in the field in addition to various aspects of the open source community. I worked on Explainable AI at Sony, and on Domain Adaptation at Sheffield. Besides, multiple research projects and publications has made me well versed with different fields of research in AI and ML.
